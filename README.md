# libft

LIBFT is the first project for School 42 in which you build your very own library of functions that prove to be extremely useful and mandatory for upcoming projects.

## Objective

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.

Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

## Usage

```C
$ make
$ #include "libft.h"
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. libft.a
```
